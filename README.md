ðŸŒŸPrompt Engineering-ChatGPT

GPT-Generative Pre-trained Transformers, Large language models are generative AI tools used to generate human-like text in response to a prompt(Input). The latest version can also work with the images.

Here is how I practiced prompt engineering by understanding the model's strengths and weaknesses. The main strength of ChatGPT is language processing and multilingual and its weakness is a lack of real-world understanding where its knowledge is not updated and its data are trained up to September 2021.

LLM-Large Language Model includes GPT-3 and BERT. They are tools that can process and generate text based on patterns in the data they were trained on, but they do not possess understanding or consciousness in the way humans do. These things are important to keep in mind when working with AI models.

We have various prompt techniquesðŸ‘‡
ðŸ‘‰Zero-shot: It generates a response without feeding the large language models.
ðŸ‘‰Chain-Of-Thought: It is to break down a complex question or topic into smaller ones and create a sequence of prompts that build upon each other and each idea is linked to the previous one and builds a deeper understanding.
We have Creative Writing, Context Expansion, Content Summarization
, Template Filling, and so on.

ðŸŽ“I have a prompt with "Consider yourself an HR and I am a final year student. Now you are going to conduct the last round you are going to ask questions one by one and I am going to reply you need to evaluate".

You can practice prompts by following these steps and refine your prompt-writing skills:

ðŸ‘‰ Construct a clear instruction
ðŸ‘‰Provide context
ðŸ‘‰Use example
ðŸ‘‰Evaluate responses
ðŸ‘‰Refine and learn

You can use these AI tools for your business, personal use, studies, research, and so on. These Generative AI tools will assist you and help to grow your business and self-improvement.ðŸŒŸ
